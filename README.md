# pythonProject1 This has image mosaicing

# pythonproject2 This has image segmentation

In terms of hours dedicated, i guess i made them both in 20 hours (not days)
I knew python as it was there in my 11th and 12th but it was my first time with opencv and all this projects
I really was dedicated and worked hard for it and hoping a positive response from your side
